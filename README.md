## Fuga Doce - Sweet Escape

This is a Super Mario style game that features Super Vanellope running and jumping through the amazing Candy World while the bad Donut guards try to stop her.

If a donut guard hits Vanellope, the player loses health.

If Super Vanellope eats a Brigadeiro Candy, she gets her sweet car - until its Coke fuel ends or a guard hits her!

In the car the mode, the player can hit the space bar to fire the rainbow, destroying incoming Donut guard!
